# Autocell

Download autocell files and add them to the MATLAB path.
Be sure to also download and install the Bio-Formats MATLAB toolbox (https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/).
After autocell and Bio-Formats are installed, type 'autocell' at the MATLAB prompt and autocell should open.
